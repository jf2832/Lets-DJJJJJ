            <p>The student page is divided in two main parts. On the left column we have the general curriculumn, which is made of <em>set up equipments</em>, <em>video tutorials</em>, and <em>practice</em>. Students are first asked to set up their DJ equipments in order to learn DJ. Then after watching the video 1 on setting cue points and song structure, they will understand the simplest idea of DJ. Then the practice stage, they will listen to one song and set cue points as the song goes on, which will be evaluated and given feedback<span class="bg-danger">(interactive functions not developed yet)</span>.</p>
  <p class="bg-danger">New feature will come up soon where students can practice on a virtual controller on the webpage without using a real device. This is to prepare them before practicing in real life.</p>
  <p>On the right column, we have a community-based study where students can submit their music records to the community and check others' works. They can also comment and interact with each other.</p>
